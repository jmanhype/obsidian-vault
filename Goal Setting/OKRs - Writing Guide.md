# OKRs - Writing Guide

## Overview

This comprehensive guide walks you through writing effective OKRs that drive focus, alignment, and measurable results. Learn the art and science of crafting objectives that inspire and key results that measure what matters.

## The OKR Writing Formula

### Basic Structure
```
I will [Objective]
as measured by [Key Results]
via [Key Initiatives and Projects]
```

### Real Example
```
I will delight our customers with an amazing product experience
as measured by:
- NPS score increasing from 40 to 60
- Monthly active users growing from 100K to 150K
- Customer support tickets decreasing by 30%
via:
- Redesigning onboarding flow
- Implementing in-app help system
- Launching customer feedback program
```

## Writing Great Objectives

### Characteristics of Effective Objectives

1. **Qualitative and Inspirational**
   - Should excite and motivate the team
   - Paint a picture of success
   - Connect to larger purpose

2. **Clear and Memorable**
   - Simple language everyone understands
   - Easy to recall without looking up
   - No jargon or acronyms

3. **Time-Bound**
   - Typically quarterly (3 months)
   - Clear start and end date
   - Achievable within timeframe

4. **Aligned with Strategy**
   - Supports company mission
   - Advances strategic priorities
   - Creates meaningful progress

### Objective Writing Templates

#### Growth-Focused
- "Become the [superlative] in [category]"
- "Establish ourselves as [position] in [market]"
- "Expand our reach to [new segment/geography]"

#### Quality-Focused
- "Deliver [adjective] [product/service] that [outcome]"
- "Create a [characteristic] experience for [audience]"
- "Build the most [quality] [offering] in [industry]"

#### Transformation-Focused
- "Transform how we [process/activity]"
- "Revolutionize [aspect] of our [area]"
- "Modernize our approach to [domain]"

### Common Objective Mistakes

❌ **Too Vague**: "Improve the product"
✅ **Better**: "Create a product customers can't live without"

❌ **Too Tactical**: "Launch 5 new features"
✅ **Better**: "Delight power users with advanced capabilities"

❌ **Too Many**: Having 10+ objectives
✅ **Better**: Focus on 3-5 maximum

## Writing Measurable Key Results

### The Anatomy of a Great Key Result

1. **Quantifiable**
   - Has a number
   - Can be measured objectively
   - Progress is trackable

2. **Specific**
   - Clear what's being measured
   - Unambiguous success criteria
   - Defined measurement method

3. **Time-Bound**
   - Has a deadline
   - Milestones if appropriate
   - Aligns with objective timeline

4. **Aggressive but Achievable**
   - 70% confidence level
   - Stretches the team
   - Not impossible

### Key Result Formulas

#### Increase/Decrease Formula
```
[Increase/Decrease] [metric] from [current] to [target]
```
Example: Increase conversion rate from 2% to 3.5%

#### Achieve Formula
```
Achieve [number] [unit] of [metric]
```
Example: Achieve $1M in new recurring revenue

#### Deliver Formula
```
Deliver [number] [deliverable] by [date]
```
Example: Deliver 3 major product releases by end of Q2

#### Maintain Formula
```
Maintain [metric] at/above/below [threshold]
```
Example: Maintain customer churn below 5%

### Types of Key Results

#### Leading Indicators
Predict future success
- User engagement metrics
- Pipeline metrics
- Quality scores

#### Lagging Indicators
Confirm past performance
- Revenue
- Customer count
- Market share

#### Input Metrics
Measure effort/activity
- Features shipped
- Calls made
- Content created

#### Output Metrics
Measure results/outcomes
- Deals closed
- Users acquired
- Problems solved

### Key Result Anti-Patterns

❌ **Task Lists**
- Wrong: "Implement user authentication"
- Right: "Achieve 95% login success rate"

❌ **Binary Outcomes**
- Wrong: "Launch the new website"
- Right: "Drive 10,000 visits to new website in first week"

❌ **Unmeasurable**
- Wrong: "Improve code quality"
- Right: "Reduce bug count by 40%"

## The Necessary and Sufficient Test

### Two Critical Questions

Before finalizing your OKRs, ask:

1. **Necessary Test**
   - "Are all these Key Results necessary to achieve the Objective?"
   - Remove any KR that doesn't directly contribute
   - Each KR should be essential

2. **Sufficient Test**
   - "If we achieve all Key Results, will we achieve the Objective?"
   - Add KRs if gaps exist
   - The set should be complete

### Example Application

**Objective**: Become the most trusted platform for freelancers

**Key Results** (First Draft):
1. Increase user signups by 50%
2. Launch mobile app
3. Improve website speed

**Necessary Test**: Is website speed necessary for trust? Maybe not directly.
**Sufficient Test**: If we have more users and a mobile app, are we most trusted? No!

**Revised Key Results**:
1. Achieve 4.5+ star rating on review platforms
2. Reduce payment disputes by 60%
3. Reach 90% user satisfaction score
4. Get 1000+ positive testimonials

## Cascading and Alignment

### Vertical Alignment

```
Company OKR
    ↓
Department OKR
    ↓
Team OKR
    ↓
Individual OKR
```

### Example Cascade

**Company Objective**: Dominate the enterprise market
**Company KR**: Increase enterprise revenue from $10M to $25M

**Sales Team Objective**: Build a world-class enterprise sales motion
**Sales Team KR**: Close 50 enterprise deals (>$100K each)

**Individual Objective**: Become a trusted advisor to enterprise clients
**Individual KR**: Build relationships with 20 C-level executives

### Horizontal Alignment

Ensure dependencies between teams are explicit:

- Marketing KR: Generate 500 enterprise leads
- Sales KR: Convert 10% of marketing leads
- Product KR: Achieve 90% feature parity with enterprise needs
- Success KR: Maintain 95% enterprise retention

## Scoring and Grading

### The 0.0 to 1.0 Scale

- **0.0 - 0.3**: Failed to make real progress
- **0.4 - 0.6**: Made progress but fell short
- **0.7 - 0.9**: Delivered strong results

### Scoring Guidelines

1. **Linear Scoring**
   - KR: Increase users from 1000 to 2000
   - Achieved: 1600 users
   - Score: 0.6 (60% of target increase)

2. **Binary Scoring**
   - KR: Launch in 3 new markets
   - Achieved: Launched in 2 markets
   - Score: 0.67 (2 out of 3)

3. **Milestone Scoring**
   - KR: Complete migration by Q2
   - Milestones: Planning (0.2), Development (0.5), Testing (0.2), Launch (0.1)
   - Score based on completed milestones

### What Good Scores Look Like

- **Average of 0.7**: Healthy stretch and achievement
