## Common Objections and Responses

### Objection Handling Framework
```yaml
objection_1:
  statement: "We're already working with [Big Consulting Firm]"
  response: "That's great for strategy - I focus on hands-on implementation. My clients often use me to execute what big firms recommend, at 20% of the cost."

objection_2:
  statement: "We don't have budget right now"
  response: "I understand. What if I could show you how to fund this through efficiency gains? My assessment identifies savings that typically cover our entire engagement cost within 60 days."

objection_3:
  statement: "We want to build capabilities internally"
  response: "That's exactly what I help with - enablement, not dependency. I train your team to be self-sufficient. Think of me as an accelerator, not a long-term contractor."

objection_4:
  statement: "How do we know this will work for us?"
  response: "Fair question. Let's start with a $25K pilot. If you don't see clear value and path to ROI, we stop there. But in 20+ engagements, we've always continued to full implementation."
