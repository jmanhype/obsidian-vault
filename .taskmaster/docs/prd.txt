PROJECT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT: Obsidian Knowledge Management System Enhancement

## Project Overview
Enhance the Obsidian Knowledge Management System with advanced AI-powered features for automatic categorization, intelligent linking, and workflow automation.

## Core Features

### 1. AI-Powered Note Classification
- Automatically categorize notes based on content analysis
- Apply appropriate tags and move to correct databases
- Detect entropy levels (zero, low, medium, high) for technical insights
- Suggest related notes and connections

### 2. Smart Template Selection
- Detect note type and suggest appropriate template
- Auto-fill metadata based on content analysis
- Generate GIF suggestions for visual enhancement
- Create initial structure based on note purpose

### 3. MCP Server Integration Dashboard
- Visual status board for all connected MCP servers
- Real-time connection monitoring
- One-click server management (add/remove/restart)
- API key validation and health checks

### 4. Task Master Workflow Automation
- Automatic PRD parsing from meeting notes
- Task generation with priority scoring
- Progress tracking with visual indicators
- Integration with Kanban board for project management

### 5. Knowledge Base Intelligence
- Identify knowledge gaps in documentation
- Suggest areas for expansion
- Detect outdated information
- Generate relationship maps between concepts

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- Obsidian plugin using TypeScript
- React components for dashboards
- D3.js for visualization
- WebSocket for real-time updates

### Backend
