## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Claude Code Sub-agents**: Custom agents + task tool agents (up to 10 concurrent)
2. **Hooks System**: PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Notification, Stop hooks with regex pattern matching
3. **MCP Integration**: JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol with 87 available tools
4. **VSM Hierarchy**: 5-layer cybernetic system (S1-S5)

### Performance Metrics (Referenced)
- **SWE-Bench Performance**: 84.8% solve rate
- **Token Efficiency**: 32.3% reduction through smart task breakdown
- **Speed Improvements**: 2.8-4.4x speedup with parallel coordination
- **Enterprise Deployments**: 15-minute completion time
- **Self-healing**: 91% success rate
- **State Recovery**: 100% success rate

### Installation & Usage
```bash
# Installation
make install
make dev

# Quick Start (requires OpenAI key for embeddings)
uv run automagik-hive genie  # Starts Claude Code with genie system prompt
uvx automagik-hive init workspacepath  # Creates AI folder with template agents

# Development Tools
npx automagik-forge  # Kanban parallelization + 1-click PR
```
