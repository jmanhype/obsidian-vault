# Vibe Coding Pattern

**Pattern Type**: Development Paradigm
**Source**: Automagik Hive
**Category**: Natural Language Programming

## Definition

Writing natural language instructions that become functional code or behavior without traditional programming syntax.

## Structure

```yaml
name: agent_name
instructions: |
  Natural language describing what you want.
  Be specific about behaviors and constraints.
  The system interprets this as executable logic.
```

## Implementation

### Classic Example
```yaml
name: researcher
instructions: |
  You find information and validate sources.
  You're thorough but concise.
  You cite everything.
```

This natural language becomes a functional agent without writing code.

## Forces

- **Problem**: Traditional programming has high barrier to entry
- **Solution**: Natural language as interface
- **Trade-off**: Less precise control for easier expression

## Consequences

### Benefits
- Accessibility to non-programmers
- Rapid prototyping
- Focus on intent over implementation
- Self-documenting code

### Liabilities
- Ambiguity in natural language
- Unpredictable edge cases
- Harder to debug
- Performance overhead

## Known Uses

1. **Automagik Hive**: Agent definitions
2. **GitHub Copilot**: Code from comments
3. **ChatGPT Code Interpreter**: Natural language to Python
4. **Cursor/Windsurf**: AI-powered IDEs

## Variations

### Strict Vibe Coding
Purely natural language, no structure

### Structured Vibe Coding
Natural language within YAML/JSON framework

### Hybrid Vibe Coding
Mix of natural language and code snippets

## Implementation Notes

```python
def interpret_vibe(instructions: str) -> Callable:
    """Convert natural language to executable behavior"""
    # Parse intent
    # Map to capabilities
    # Generate execution plan
    # Return callable function
```
