# Performance retention vs model compression
model_comparison = {

# Performance efficiency metric
for i, model in enumerate(model_comparison['model']):
    efficiency = model_comparison['task_performance'][i] / model_comparison['parameters_B'][i]
    print(f"{model}: {efficiency:.1f} performance per billion parameters")

## Performance Optimization Findings

### Best Practices for Maximum Performance

1. **Task Definition**
   - Narrow, well-defined tasks: 95%+ performance
   - Broad, open-ended tasks: <60% performance
   - Clear input/output schemas improve accuracy

2. **Model Selection**
   - Use 350M for simple extraction/classification
   - Use 1.2B for complex extraction/translation
   - Don't use for creative or reasoning tasks

3. **Deployment Optimization**
   - Batch processing improves throughput 3x
   - Quantization reduces size 50-75% with <5% accuracy loss
   - Platform-specific optimization adds 20-30% speed
