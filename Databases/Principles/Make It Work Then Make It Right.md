# Make It Work, Then Make It Right, Then Make It Fast

![Building blocks progressively getting better](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7btNa0RUYa5E7iiQ/giphy.gif)

## Core Truth
Get a working solution first, optimize later.

## Why Zero Entropy
This sequence **always** produces better results than premature optimization. No exceptions found across millions of engineering projects.

## The Sequence
1. **Make it work** - Solve the problem, even if ugly
2. **Make it right** - Refactor for clarity and maintainability  
3. **Make it fast** - Optimize only what's measurably slow

## Universal Application
- Software development
- Business processes
- Learning new skills
- Problem-solving in any domain

## Anti-patterns Avoided
- Premature optimization
- Analysis paralysis
- Over-engineering
- Perfect being enemy of good

## Proof
Every successful system followed this path. Systems that tried to be perfect from the start either failed or never shipped.
