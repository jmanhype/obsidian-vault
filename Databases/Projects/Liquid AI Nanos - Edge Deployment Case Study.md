## Implementation Strategy

### Approach: Task-Specific Optimization
```yaml
methodology:
  phase_1_analysis:
    - Identify narrow but high-value use cases
    - Analyze task boundaries and requirements
    - Define success metrics
    
  phase_2_distillation:
    - Select teacher models (GPT-4o, Claude, etc.)
    - Create task-specific training datasets
    - Implement knowledge distillation pipeline
    
  phase_3_optimization:
    - Apply reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF)
    - Iterative model merging and pruning
    - Performance benchmarking against larger models
    
  phase_4_deployment:
    - Platform-specific optimization (MLX, ONNX, TFLite)
    - Edge device testing and validation
    - Production rollout with monitoring
```
