### Sample Outreach Template

Hi [Name],

My name is [Your Name] and I wanted to reach out since I noticed you recently took on the AI enablement role at [Company]. 

I work with companies like yours focusing on AI enablement where we ran a 15-day campaign on AI governance and cultural transformation at [Similar Company], resulting in 40% adoption rate increase.

I also provide frameworks and tools for AI adoption and governance which might align with your mandate, particularly around:
- Change management frameworks specific to AI integration
- AI fluency training programs that scale
- Success metrics and ROI measurement

Would love to chat next week if this aligns with what you're doing and you need outside experts to help drive this.

Best,
[Your Name]
