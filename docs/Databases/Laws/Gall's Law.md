# Gall's Law

![Simple seed growing into complex tree](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6Zt6KHxJTbXCnSvu/giphy.gif)

## The Law
"A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work."

## Why Zero Entropy
- No successful complex system has violated this
- Every attempt to build complex from scratch has failed
- Fundamental constraint of human cognitive capacity

## The Only Path to Complexity
1. Start simple
2. Ensure it works
3. Evolve incrementally
4. Maintain working state throughout

## Failed Attempts to Violate
- Waterfall software projects
- Centrally planned economies  
- Grand unified theories without incremental validation
- "Big bang" rewrites of working systems

## Successful Applications
- Unix → Linux
- ARPANET → Internet
- Wright Flyer → Modern aircraft
- Single cell → Complex organisms

## Implications
- Never do a "ground-up rewrite"
- Always have a working system
- Complexity must be grown, not built
- Evolution beats intelligent design
