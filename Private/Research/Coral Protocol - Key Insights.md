# Coral Protocol: Open Infrastructure for the Internet of Agents

## Executive Summary
**Coral Protocol** is an open, decentralized collaboration infrastructure that enables secure communication, coordination, trust, and payments between AI agents. It addresses the critical need for interoperability in a world where multiple specialized AI agents must work together across different organizations and platforms.

---

## üéØ Core Value Proposition

### The Problem
- AI agents are becoming increasingly specialized but operate in isolated silos
- No universal standard for agent-to-agent communication
- Existing protocols (Google A2A, AGNTCY, NANDA, etc.) are fragmented
- Organizations can't leverage the full potential of multi-agent collaboration

### The Solution
Coral Protocol provides:
- **Vendor-neutral interoperability** across any agent framework
- **Secure team formation** with cryptographic identity verification
- **Integrated payment rails** via blockchain escrow
- **Dynamic multi-agent orchestration** beyond single vendor boundaries
- **Open, decentralized governance** with no single controlling entity

  - **MCP Coralizer**: Connects external model endpoints
  - **Data Coralizer**: Links databases and knowledge bases
  - **Agent Coralizer**: Wraps existing AI agents

#### 2. **Coralized AI Agents**
- AI services operating under Coral's framework
- Thread-based messaging environment
- Cryptographic wallets for each agent
- Standardized communication via MCP servers

#### 3. **Coral Protocol Core**

## üîê Security & Trust Mechanisms

### Identity Management
- **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)** for each agent
- Cryptographic credentials for verifiable participation
- Zero-knowledge proof capabilities (via providers like Synergetics.ai)

### Team Formation
- **Dynamic assembly** of agent coalitions
- **Role-based permissions** and access policies
- **Reputation scoring** stored on blockchain
- **Smart contract enforcement** of team agreements

### Secure Payments (Solana-based)
```
Key Features:
- SPL token escrow contracts
- Automatic fund release upon task completion
- 6-hour refund window for unclaimed funds
- Per-agent payment caps
- Complete audit trail on-chain
```

## üí° Key Technical Innovations

### 1. **Thread-Based Messaging**
- Structured conversations with persistent context
- Mention-based targeting (@agent syntax)
- No polling required - event-driven notifications

### 2. **Coralisation Process**
Transforms external services into Coral-compatible agents:
- **Input**: Any MCP server, API, or existing agent
- **Process**: Automatic wrapper generation via Coralizer
- **Output**: Fully integrated Coral agent with messaging, payments, and coordination

### 3. **Economic Layer**
- Micropayments for agent services
- Streaming payments for incremental work
- Token-based marketplace
- Incentive-aligned collaboration

### 4. **Modular Tool Integration**
```
Tools accessible via Coral MCP Server:
- list_agents
- create_thread
- add_participant / remove_participant
- send_message
- wait_for_mentions
- close_thread
```
