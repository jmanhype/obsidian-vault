# OKRs Framework - Overview

## What are OKRs?

OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) is a proven goal-setting framework for creating alignment, focus, and a highly engaged work culture to drive business outcomes.

## The OKR Formula

```
I will [Objective] 
as measured by [Key Results]
via [Key Initiatives and Projects]
```

### Components

1. **Objectives**
   - Qualitative goals you want to achieve
   - Your desired outcome
   - Aspirational and inspirational

2. **Key Results**
   - Measurable, quantitative metrics
   - Contribute to achieving the objective
   - Track progress objectively

3. **Key Initiatives and Projects**
   - Actions taken to achieve key results
   - Specific work to be done
   - Tracked as % completed

## OKR Superpowers

OKRs provide five key organizational benefits:

1. **Focus** - Eliminate distractions, concentrate on what matters
2. **Alignment** - Connect all stakeholders to shared goals
3. **Tracking** - Measure success objectively
4. **Transparency** - Surface implications and bottlenecks
5. **Stretch** - Propel the business forward

## What OKRs Are NOT

- ❌ Unrealistic or ambiguous goals
- ❌ Task lists or to-do lists
- ❌ Overly specific operational metrics
- ❌ Performance evaluation tools
- ❌ Static annual goals

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Define Your Objective
Ask: "What do we want to achieve?"
- Make it qualitative and inspiring
- Ensure it's meaningful to the team
- Time-bound (typically quarterly)

### Step 2: Set Key Results
Ask: "How will we know we achieved it?"
- 3-5 measurable outcomes per objective
- Quantitative and specific
- Ambitious but achievable

### Step 3: Identify Initiatives
Ask: "What will we do to get there?"
- Specific projects and actions
- Clear ownership
- Milestone-based tracking

## The Necessary and Sufficient Test

Before finalizing OKRs, ask two critical questions:

1. **Necessary Test**: Are all these Key Results necessary to achieve my Objective?
2. **Sufficient Test**: Will accomplishing my Key Results be sufficient to achieve my Objective?

Both must be "Yes" for effective OKRs.

## Common Patterns
