**License**: Dual (AGPLv3 + Commercial)
**Version**: 0.1.4 (August 2025)

Self-hosted AI research assistant that manages complex research tasks from start to finish.

### 2. The WRITER Agentic Framework

Five specialized agents working in collaboration:

1. **Agent Controller (Orchestrator)**
   - Manages entire mission
   - Delegates tasks to appropriate agents
   - Ensures workflow progression

2. **Planning Agent (Strategist)**
   - Transforms requests into structured research plans
   - Creates hierarchical report outlines
   - Provides clear roadmap for mission

3. **Research Agent (Investigator)**
   - Executes research plan
   - Uses RAG pipeline for documents
   - Web search capabilities (Jina.ai integration)
   - Organizes findings into ResearchNote objects

4. **Reflection Agent (Critical Reviewer)**
   - Reviews work of other agents
   - Identifies knowledge gaps
   - Drives iterative improvement loops
   - Ensures quality and accuracy

5. **Writing Agent (Synthesizer)**
   - Takes research notes
   - Weaves coherent narrative
   - Follows report outline
   - Generates publication-ready output

### 3. Iterative Research Process

#### Research-Reflection Loop
```
Research Agent gathers info
    ↓
Reflection Agent critiques:
- Are there gaps?
- Do sources contradict?
- New themes emerged?
    ↓
Loop continues until comprehensive
```

#### Writing-Reflection Loop
```
Writing Agent produces draft
    ↓
Reflection Agent reviews:
- Clarity and coherence?
- Logical flow?
- Source fidelity?
    ↓
Revisions until quality met
```

## Strategic Implications for Chris's Pitch

### How This Validates Our Approach

1. **Multi-Agent Collaboration Works**
   - 808+ stars proves community validation
   - Production use in academia and R&D
   - Similar architecture to our proposal

2. **Iterative Loops Are Key**
   - Research-Reflection pattern matches our quality approach
   - Writing-Reflection ensures accuracy
   - Critical for compliance in insolvency

3. **Document Processing at Scale**
   - 2,300+ papers handled successfully
   - 70% time reduction proven
   - Validates our document-heavy use case

### Architectural Patterns We Can Adopt

#### The WRITER Pattern Applied to Insolvency

| WRITER Agent | Insolvency Equivalent | Function |
|-------------|----------------------|----------|
| Controller | Case Manager | Orchestrates case processing |
| Planning | Strategy Agent | Plans case approach |
| Research | Document Processor | Extracts from claims/filings |
| Reflection | Compliance Checker | Reviews for accuracy/compliance |
| Writing | Report Generator | Creates court filings |

#### Iterative Quality Loops

```python
# Insolvency Processing Loop
while not compliant:
    process = DocumentProcessor.extract()
    review = ComplianceChecker.validate()
    if review.has_issues():
        process = DocumentProcessor.refine()
    else:
        compliant = True
```

### Key Differentiators

| Maestro WRITER | Our Insolvency Solution |
|---------------|------------------------|
| General research | Domain-specific for insolvency |
| Academic papers | Legal documents & claims |
| Research reports | Court filings & distributions |
| Any domain | Bankruptcy law expertise |

### Integration Opportunities

1. **Use WRITER pattern** for document processing
2. **Adopt reflection loops** for compliance
3. **Implement mission control** for case tracking
4. **Apply RAG pipeline** for precedent search

## Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1: Adapt WRITER Framework
- Map 5 agents to insolvency roles
