# Natural Language Container Control Pattern

![Containers orchestrating themselves with voice commands](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7TKSjRrfIPjeiVyM/giphy.gif)

## Intent
Enable natural language control of container operations, builds, and CI/CD pipelines through AI assistants.

## The Architecture Formula
```
Apollo MCP + Dagger = Natural Language → Container Operations
```

## Components

### Apollo MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- Provides structured communication between Claude and external systems
- Handles tool registration and execution
- Manages context and state across operations

### Dagger
- Programmable CI/CD engine
- Container orchestration as code
- DAG-based pipeline execution
- Language-agnostic SDK

### Claude Code
- Natural language interface
- Intent understanding
- Command translation
- Error interpretation and recovery

## Implementation Pattern

```typescript
// Apollo MCP Server exposing Dagger operations
class ContainerControlMCP {
  @tool("build_container")
  async buildContainer(description: string) {
    // Translate natural language to Dagger pipeline
    const pipeline = dagger.pipeline(description);
    return await pipeline.build();
  }
  
  @tool("deploy_service")
  async deployService(intent: string) {
    // Parse intent, create Dagger DAG
    const deployment = dagger.interpret(intent);
    return await deployment.run();
  }
}
```

## Natural Language Examples

**User**: "Build a Node.js container with Redis cache"
**Claude → Apollo MCP → Dagger**: 
```javascript
dagger.container()
  .from("node:18")
  .withService("redis")
  .withExec(["npm", "install"])
  .build()
```

**User**: "Deploy this to staging with health checks"
**Claude → Apollo MCP → Dagger**:
```javascript
dagger.deploy()
  .toEnvironment("staging")
  .withHealthCheck("/health")
  .withRollback()
  .execute()
```

## Benefits
- **Zero Learning Curve** - Speak naturally, get containers
- **Self-Documenting** - Intent is the documentation
- **Error Recovery** - AI understands and fixes issues
- **Cross-Platform** - Works with any container runtime

## When to Use
- Rapid prototyping of containerized services
- Complex multi-stage build pipelines
- Dynamic CI/CD workflows
- Teaching/learning container operations

## When NOT to Use
- Production-critical deployments without review
- Security-sensitive operations
- Compliance-regulated environments (without audit)

## Real World Applications
- **Development environments** - "Spin up a dev stack with Postgres and Redis"
- **CI/CD pipelines** - "Build, test, and deploy on green tests"
- **Microservices** - "Create a new service with standard telemetry"
- **Testing** - "Run integration tests in isolated containers"

## The Power Equation
```
Natural Language (Claude)
    ↓
Structured Tools (Apollo MCP)
    ↓
Container Operations (Dagger)
    ↓
Running Systems
```
