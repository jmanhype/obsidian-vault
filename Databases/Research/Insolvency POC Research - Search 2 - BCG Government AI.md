## Risk Mitigation Insights

### Common Failure Points (per BCG)
1. **Lack of executive buy-in** → Solution: Start with POC proof
2. **Poor data quality** → Solution: Our agents handle messy data
3. **Resistance to change** → Solution: 500% self-service (Singapore model)
4. **Compliance concerns** → Solution: Government-grade from day one
5. **Scalability issues** → Solution: Maestro orchestration built for scale

## Implementation Acceleration

### BCG Timeline vs Ours
| Phase | BCG Timeline | Our Timeline | Acceleration |
