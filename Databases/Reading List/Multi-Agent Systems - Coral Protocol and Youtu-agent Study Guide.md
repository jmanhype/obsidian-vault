## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Hello World Comparison
```python
"""
Implement the same agent in both frameworks:
1. Responds to greetings
2. Maintains conversation context
3. Charges micro-payment (Coral) or tracks usage (Youtu)
"""

# Coral Implementation
class CoralGreeter:
    # Your code here
    pass

# Youtu Implementation (+ YAML)
youtu_config = """
agent:
  name: greeter
  instructions: "Friendly greeting agent"
"""
```

### Exercise 2: Multi-Agent Coordination
```python
"""
Create a system where:
1. Agent A gathers information
2. Agent B processes it
3. Agent C generates report
4. Implement in both frameworks
5. Compare complexity and performance
"""
```

### Exercise 3: Payment Flow Design
```python
"""
Design payment system that:
1. Accepts multiple currencies
2. Handles escrow
3. Distributes to multiple agents
4. Works with both frameworks
"""
```
