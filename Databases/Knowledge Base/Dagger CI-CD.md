# Dagger CI/CD

**Type**: Container Orchestration Platform
**Domain**: CI/CD Pipeline Automation
**Key Innovation**: Programmable pipelines as code using containers as first-class objects

## Overview

Dagger is an open-source runtime for composable workflows that enables developers to write CI/CD pipelines in real programming languages (Go, Python, TypeScript) instead of YAML or bash scripts. It treats containers as first-class objects and provides a powerful GraphQL API for language-agnostic pipeline execution.

## Core Architecture

### GraphQL API Foundation

```graphql
# Every pipeline operation is a GraphQL query
type Container {
  withExec(args: [String!]!): Container!
  withDirectory(path: String!, directory: DirectoryID!): Container!
  withEnvVariable(name: String!, value: String!): Container!
  stdout: String!
}
```

The Dagger Engine runs pipeline definitions and returns results through a unified GraphQL interface, providing:
- Universal type system
- Dynamic introspection
- Language-agnostic execution
- Natural insertion point for infrastructure control

### Container-Native Operations

```python
# Python SDK example
import dagger

async def pipeline():
    async with dagger.Connection() as client:
        # Containers as first-class objects
        container = (
            client.container()
            .from_("node:18")
            .with_directory("/app", client.host().directory("."))
            .with_exec(["npm", "install"])
            .with_exec(["npm", "test"])
        )
        
        # Get results
        result = await container.stdout()
```

## Key Features (2024)

### 1. Multi-Language SDKs
- **Native SDKs**: Go, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript
- **GraphQL Clients**: 20+ additional languages
- **Type-safe operations** across all SDKs

### 2. Dagger Functions
Reusable abstractions built on primitives:

```go
// Go function example
func Build(ctx context.Context, source *Directory) *Container {
    return dag.Container().
        From("golang:1.21").
        WithDirectory("/src", source).
        WithExec([]string{"go", "build", "-o", "app"})
}
```

### 3. Resource Management
- vCPUs allocation
- Memory management  
- vGPU support
- Automatic caching
- Isolated execution environments

## Pipeline Execution Model

### Session Architecture

```
1. New session opens with engine
2. GraphQL server instance created
3. Module loaded into session
4. Functions execute in containers
5. Resources allocated per requirements
```

### Type System

Basic building blocks:
- **Container**: Isolated execution environment
- **Directory**: File system operations
- **File**: Individual file handling
- **Secret**: Secure value management
- **LLM**: AI model integration (new)

## Integration Patterns

### 1. CLI Integration

```bash
# Direct CLI execution
dagger call build --source=.

# Integration with existing tools
make build:
    dagger call build --source=.
```

### 2. Kubernetes Deployment

```yaml
# Helm chart deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: dagger-engine
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: dagger
        image: registry.dagger.io/engine
```

### 3. CI Platform Integration

Compatible with:
- GitHub Actions
- GitLab CI
- CircleCI
- Jenkins
- Ansible Playbooks
- Any shell-based system

## Apollo Dagger MCP Integration

The Apollo Dagger MCP server exposes Dagger's capabilities through MCP:

```javascript
// MCP function exposure
functions: {
  'ContainerFrom': {
    parameters: { address: "string" },
    returns: "Container"
  },
  'ContainerWithExec': {
    parameters: { 
      container: "ContainerID",
      args: ["string"]
    },
    returns: "Container"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Pipeline as Code
```python
# Define pipelines in real code, not YAML
def ci_pipeline(client):
    test = run_tests(client)
    build = build_app(client)
    deploy = deploy_to_prod(client, build)
    return deploy
```

### 2. Caching Strategy
```go
// Leverage automatic caching
container.
    WithMountedCache("/cache", cacheVolume).
    WithExec([]string{"npm", "install"})
```

### 3. Resource Optimization
```python
# Configure resource limits
container.with_env_variable("GOMAXPROCS", "4")
```

## Advantages Over Traditional CI/CD

1. **No YAML Hell**: Real programming languages
2. **Local Development**: Test pipelines locally
3. **Portable**: Runs anywhere containers run
4. **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time
5. **Composable**: Build complex from simple
6. **Cached**: Automatic intelligent caching

## Zero-Entropy Insights

### 1. **Containers Are Functions**
Every container operation returns a new container, enabling functional composition.

### 2. **GraphQL Is The Universal API**
One API, infinite language support through GraphQL's ecosystem.

### 3. **Pipelines Are Programs**
CI/CD becomes software engineering, not configuration management.
