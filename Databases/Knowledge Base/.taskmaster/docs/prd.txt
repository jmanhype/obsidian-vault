PROJECT REQUIREMENTS: Knowledge Base Enhancement System

## Overview
Build a comprehensive knowledge management system to capture, organize, and synthesize technical insights and zero-entropy knowledge.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Knowledge Capture System
- Automatic extraction of key insights from documents
- Entropy level classification (zero, low, medium, high)
- Source attribution and linking
- Version tracking for evolving knowledge

### 2. Knowledge Synthesis
- Connect related concepts across domains
- Generate knowledge graphs
- Identify knowledge gaps
- Create learning pathways

### 3. Search and Discovery
- Semantic search capabilities
- Tag-based navigation
- Related knowledge suggestions
- Quick access to high-value insights

## Implementation Priorities
1. Set up knowledge templates
2. Create insight extraction pipeline
3. Build knowledge graph visualization
4. Implement semantic search
5. Develop synthesis algorithms
