## Strategic Capabilities
### "Vibe Coding" Revolution

### Traditional Development
```python
# 500+ lines of boilerplate
class BillingAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        # Complex setup...
    def process_query(self):
        # Manual orchestration...
```

### Vibe Coding Approach
```
"I need a billing support agent that handles refunds and subscription changes"
```
**Result**: Fully configured, production-ready agent in minutes

### Business Impact
- **Democratizes AI development** - no coding required
- **10x faster iteration** cycles
- **Business analysts** can create agents directly
