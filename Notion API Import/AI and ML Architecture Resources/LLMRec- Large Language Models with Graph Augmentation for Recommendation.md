methodology: LLM-based Graph Augmentation, Denoised Data Robustification
abstractsummary: This paper introduces LLMRec, a framework that enhances recommender systems using large language models with graph augmentation. It addresses data sparsity and low-quality side information, employing techniques like Bayesian Personalized Ranking and MAE-based feature enhancement.
notes: Pioneering work in the integration of LLMs in recommender systems with a focus on graph augmentation to improve recommendation accuracy.
