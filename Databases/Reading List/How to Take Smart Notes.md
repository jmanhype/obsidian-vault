# How to Take Smart Notes

## Core Concept: Zettelkasten Method
A systematic approach to note-taking that creates a personal knowledge management system.

## Key Principles
1. **Write everything down** - Don't trust memory
2. **Make notes atomic** - One idea per note
3. **Link notes together** - Create connections
4. **Develop ideas bottom-up** - Let structure emerge

## My Implementation

- Daily notes for fleeting thoughts
- Literature notes for source material
- Permanent notes for developed ideas

## Benefits Observed

- Writing becomes easier with existing notes
