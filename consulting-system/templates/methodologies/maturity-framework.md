## Decision Gates

### Human Decision Points

Each transition between maturity levels requires human approval through structured decision gates:

#### 1. POC → MVP Decision Gate
**Decision Maker**: Technical Lead + Business Sponsor
**Timeline**: 2-5 days
**Key Questions**:
- Is the technical approach viable?
- Does the POC validate the business hypothesis?
- Are resources available for MVP development?
- What are the identified risks and mitigations?

#### 2. MVP → PILOT Decision Gate  
**Decision Maker**: Technical Lead + Business Sponsor + Operations
**Timeline**: 3-7 days
**Key Questions**:
- Does the MVP meet user needs?
- Is the system ready for limited production use?
- Are operational procedures adequate?
- What is the risk tolerance for the pilot?

#### 3. PILOT → PRODUCTION Decision Gate
**Decision Maker**: Senior Leadership + Risk Committee
**Timeline**: 5-10 days
**Key Questions**:
- Has the pilot proven system stability?
- Are all compliance requirements met?
- Is the organization ready for full production?
- What is the rollback strategy?

#### 4. PRODUCTION → SCALE Decision Gate
**Decision Maker**: Executive Committee
**Timeline**: 10-15 days
**Key Questions**:
- Does business demand justify scaling investment?
- Are technical foundations sufficient for scale?
- What is the ROI projection for scaling?
- How does this align with strategic objectives?

### Automated Gate Validation

Before human decision points, automated validation ensures:

- [ ] All L1/L2/L3 requirements met
- [ ] Test suites passing
- [ ] Security scans complete
- [ ] Performance benchmarks achieved
