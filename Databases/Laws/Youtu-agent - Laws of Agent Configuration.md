# Youtu-agent: Laws of Agent Configuration

## ⚖️ Fundamental Laws
Immutable principles governing YAML-based agent systems derived from Tencent's Youtu-agent framework.

## Core Laws

### Law 1: Configuration Simplicity
**"The complexity of agent configuration inversely correlates with adoption and maintainability."**

```yaml
# Good: Simple, readable configuration
agent:
  name: researcher
  instructions: "Search and summarize information"

# Bad: Over-configured complexity
agent:
  name: researcher_v2_final_prod_optimized
  version: 2.3.1-alpha
  metadata:
    created_by: developer
    last_modified: 2025-01-01T00:00:00Z
    tags: [ai, research, web, data]
    # ... 20 more unnecessary fields
```

**Implications**:
- Minimize configuration surface area
- Default values should cover 80% of use cases
- Explicit configuration only for deviations

---

### Law 2: Tool Composition Over Monolithic Design
**"Complex agent behaviors emerge from simple tool combinations, not from complex individual tools."**

```python
# Emergent complexity from composition
simple_tools = ['search', 'read', 'write']
complex_behavior = compose(simple_tools)  # Research agent

# Anti-pattern: Monolithic tool
complex_tool = 'do_everything_tool'  # Hard to maintain, test, evolve
```

**Mathematical Expression**:
```
Utility(n tools) = Σ(tool_i) + ΣΣ(synergy(tool_i, tool_j))
where synergy > 0 for compatible tools
```

---

### Law 3: Meta-Agent Recursion
**"Agents that can create agents lead to exponential capability growth."**

```yaml
meta_agent_law:
  principle: "Self-modification through generation"
  
  growth_function: |
    Capabilities(t+1) = Capabilities(t) * (1 + learning_rate)
    where learning_rate = f(feedback, diversity)
  
  implications:
    - Auto-improvement without manual intervention
    - Evolutionary pressure toward optimal configurations
    - Emergent specialization in agent populations
```

**Recursive Definition**:
```python
class MetaAgentLaw:
    def create_agent(self, requirements):
        if is_meta_requirement(requirements):
            return MetaAgent(
                can_create=lambda req: self.create_agent(req)
            )
        return Agent(requirements)
```

---

### Law 4: Asynchronous Execution Superiority
**"Synchronous agents create bottlenecks; asynchronous agents create throughput."**

```python
# Performance law
async def performance_law():
    # Async execution: O(max(task_times))
    async_time = max([task.duration for task in tasks])
    
    # Sync execution: O(sum(task_times))
    sync_time = sum([task.duration for task in tasks])
    
    # Law: async_time << sync_time for n > 1
    efficiency_gain = sync_time / async_time
    
    return efficiency_gain  # Typically 3-10x
```

**Practical Application**:
- All I/O operations must be non-blocking
- Agent communication via message queues
- Parallel tool execution by default

---

### Law 5: Configuration as Code
**"YAML configurations are code and must be treated with the same rigor."**

```yaml
# Configuration versioning
config_version: "1.0.0"
compatible_with:
  youtu_agent: ">=0.1.0"
  
# Configuration testing
tests:
  - input: "test query"
    expected_tools: [search, summarize]
    expected_output_format: markdown
    
# Configuration validation
schema:
  $ref: "#/definitions/AgentConfig"
  required: [name, instructions]
```

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:
- Version control for all configurations
- Automated testing of config changes
- Schema validation before deployment
- Configuration linting and formatting

---

### Law 6: Benchmark-Driven Evolution
**"Agent performance must be measurable, comparable, and improvable."**

```python
class BenchmarkLaw:
    """What gets measured gets improved"""
    
    benchmarks = {
        'WebWalkerQA': 0.7147,  # Current SOTA
        'GAIA': 0.728,          # Target metric
        'Custom': None          # Define your own
    }
    
    def evolution_pressure(current_score, target_score):
        if current_score < target_score:
            return "increase_model_size_or_improve_prompts"
        elif current_score == target_score:
            return "optimize_for_efficiency"
        else:
            return "push_new_boundaries"
```

**Measurement Hierarchy**:
1. **Accuracy**: Does it work correctly?
2. **Latency**: How fast does it respond?
3. **Cost**: How much does it cost per query?
4. **Scalability**: Can it handle load?

---

### Law 7: Declarative Over Imperative
**"Describe what the agent should do, not how it should do it."**

```yaml
# Declarative (Good)
agent:
  goal: "Monitor system health and alert on anomalies"
  constraints:
    - check_interval: 60s
    - alert_threshold: 95%
    
# Imperative (Bad)
agent:
  steps:
    1. while True:
    2.   fetch_metrics()
    3.   if cpu > 95:
    4.     send_alert()
    5.   sleep(60)
```

**Benefits of Declarative**:
- Easier to understand intent
- Platform can optimize execution
- Simpler to modify behavior
- Better abstraction from implementation

---

## Derived Principles

### Conservation of Complexity
**"Complexity cannot be eliminated, only moved between configuration and code."**

```python
# Total complexity is constant
TOTAL_COMPLEXITY = CONFIG_COMPLEXITY + CODE_COMPLEXITY

# Youtu-agent philosophy: Minimize CONFIG_COMPLEXITY
# Result: Some complexity moves to framework code
```

### Tool Orthogonality
**"Tools should have single responsibilities with minimal overlap."**

```yaml
# Orthogonal tools (good)
tools:
  - search: finds information
  - summarize: condenses text
  - translate: changes language

# Overlapping tools (bad)
tools:
  - search_and_summarize: does two things
  - web_search: redundant with search
```

### Configuration Inheritance
**"Common patterns should be extractable and reusable."**

```yaml
# Base configuration
defaults:
  - /base/researcher
  - /tools/web

# Specialized configuration
agent:
  extends: researcher
  specialization: "medical research"
```

## Mathematical Foundations

### Agent Capability Formula
```
C(A) = Σ(T_i) + Σ(I_ij) - O(N)

Where:
- C(A) = Total capability of agent A
- T_i = Individual tool capabilities
- I_ij = Integration synergies between tools
- O(N) = Overhead from N tools
```

### Performance Scaling Law
```
P(n) = P(1) * n^α

Where:
- P(n) = Performance with n agents
- α ∈ [0.7, 0.9] for most workloads
- α < 1 due to coordination overhead
```

### Configuration Complexity Bound
```
Complexity ≤ k * log(n_features)

Where:
- k = constant based on user expertise
- n_features = number of configurable features
- Log growth ensures manageability
```

---

## Enforcement and Validation

### Static Validation
```python
def validate_configuration(config):
    """Enforce configuration laws"""
    
    # Law 1: Simplicity check
    assert len(config.keys()) < 10, "Too complex"
    
    # Law 5: Version check
    assert 'config_version' in config, "Version required"
    
    # Law 7: Declarative check
    assert 'steps' not in config, "Must be declarative"
    
    return True
```

### Runtime Enforcement
```python
class LawEnforcer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.laws = [
            SimplicicityLaw(),
            CompositionLaw(),
            AsynchronousLaw(),
            DeclarativeLaw()
        ]
    
    def check(self, agent):
        for law in self.laws:
            if not law.verify(agent):
                raise ViolationError(f"{law} violated")
```

## Practical Applications

### When Laws Conflict
1. **Simplicity vs Capability**: Choose simplicity, add capability incrementally
2. **Performance vs Cost**: Define clear trade-off boundaries
3. **Flexibility vs Safety**: Default to safety, opt-in to flexibility

### Law Hierarchy
1. **Inviolable**: Configuration as Code, Declarative over Imperative
2. **Strong Preference**: Simplicity, Async Execution
3. **Guidelines**: Tool Orthogonality, Inheritance
